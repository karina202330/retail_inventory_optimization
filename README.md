## 📖 About the Project

This beginner-friendly data science project uses Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to:
- Combine and clean multiple CSV files
- Analyze product performance, supplier delays, and inventory risks
- Visualize actionable insights using plots

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Python` | Programming language |
| `Pandas` | Data manipulation |
| `NumPy` | Numerical operations |
| `Matplotlib` | Data visualization |
| `Jupyter Notebook` | Development environment |

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Merge sales, inventory, and supplier datasets
- ✅ Clean and format the combined dataset
- ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Visualize key business metrics like:
  - Top-selling products
  - Revenue trends
  - Inventory vs sales mismatch
- ✅ Identify restocking needs and supplier performance

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Retail sales insights over time  
- Inventory health checks  
- Supplier lead time impact  
- Data-driven visualizations  
- Modular and reproducible code

---

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses synthetic datasets mimicking a real-world retail system:

- `sales_data.csv` – sales transactions per product  
- `inventory_data.csv` – stock levels, reorder points  
- `supplier_data.csv` – supplier cost and lead times  

All datasets are cleaned and merged into `final_ecom_data.csv`.
